# Unofficial Restoration of CrashBandicoot3.com

This project is an unofficial restoration of the 1998 video game website for “[Crash Bandicoot: Warped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot:_Warped)”, [crashbandicoot3.com](https://crash3.hteumeuleu.com).

## Scope

Only the english version of the HTML website has been restored. The Shockwave version and other languages are not available.

## Changes

* Links to the Shockwave version and unavailable languages have been disabled.
* The site now features a favicon grabbed from the modern `crashbandicoot.com` site. I didn’t find any evidence the original site had one.
* The video in the Goodies page has been reencoded to be playable in a modern Quicktime version. The  `crash3.zip` file that contains this video is now only 1 MB. (But I left the site state the original file size of `2.74Mb`.)
* One line of CSS has been added to every page to adjust margins on paragraphs and to fix the pages background image’s attachment.

## Missing Assets
