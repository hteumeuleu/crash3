<p align="left"><b>Scarab Beetle (continued)</b> - When breeding, scarab
 beetles take great care to give their lavae the best possible chance in
 life by raising them on a healthy diet.  Wood mulch forming on the 
inside of rotting logs is ideal; but, when pushed, other decomposing 
plant material such as leaf mulch or compost can provide healthy snacks.
  The best material is dung as it has a naturally warm feel.</p>

<p align="left">After a period of gestation in their chosen incubation 
medium, the scarab lavae will reach maximum size.  At this point they 
will make small, oval soil cocoons for themselves.  They will then stay 
there for about a month reading the paper before hatching out as 
fully-fledged adult beetles ready to deal with the responsibilities of 
life.</p>
