<p align="left"><b>Tiger</b> - The tiger is the largest member of the 
Cat family and is thought to have originated in the Pleistocene epoch of
 the Quaternary Period.  Tigers traditionally live lonely existences and
 find it difficult to make friends. They would say that this has 
absolutely nothing to do with either the size of their claws or the 
sharpness of their teeth.  Many of their enemies would disagree.  Baby 
tigers have lovely, bouncy personalities, which is a pity, because in 
later life the probability of them turning into miserable loners is 
quite high.<br>

Treat a tiger right when it's young though, and it'll do practically anything for you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
