 you can see on the ramps, and on Coco as she rides the jet-ski, we've 
expanded the Z-buffer so that it is effectively as good as any 
hardware's going to give you.  It's software driven but it's completely 
free-form - you can do what you want to do with it.  Likewise, the bombs
 and the buoys are flat, which is a standard thing to do in these games.
	We don't allow the water to split the flat plane as a flat plane, 
instead (and you can see it well on the bombs) you get a curved cut 
around the flat plane, so you can preserve the round effect of the round
 shape.</font></font></p><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2" color="#ff9900"><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2" color="White">
