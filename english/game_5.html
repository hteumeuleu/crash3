<p>That's because the only important thing whilst looking for Relics is your speed. Each level has a set time, and you have to get to the end of it faster than the set time in order to win a Relic. To help you, there are -1, -2 and -3 second boxes which subtract from the overall time if you hit them.</p>

<p>If you're trying to shave those last few tenths off your time to get a Relic, it's important to decide whether you take the longer route to get some extra seconds off or not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>
Each time you get a fastest score on a Time Trial level you have the option of entering your name and adding it to your Memory Card save.  That way you can swap saves with friends and rivals with the same move-set and individual best times for every level.</p>
