<p align="left"><b>Scorpion</b> - Scorpions are arachnids, which means 
it's perfectly alright to be petrified of them.  They have eight legs 
(two of which have outsized claws attached) and a segmented tail housing
 the infamous sting.  Brown in colour, they like warm places, and who 
can blame them?  One rare species, the <i>Ceilingoicles Hanguratus</i> 
is said to lie in wait for its prey whilst suspending itself from the 
ceiling.  Like all scorpions, this variety possesses a neurotoxin in its
 sting which has had the effect of making prey go drifting off into 
space.  Creepy.</p>
