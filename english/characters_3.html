<b>Dr Neo Cortex</b> - Crash's old opponent has an inability to know 
when to give up.  Having said that, in this episode of the pair's 
battles, Neo Cortex does seem slightly resigned to the fact that history
 is repeating itself.  Maybe his mastery of time has told him something 
nobody else knows, but not even his new ally Uka-Uka can get Cortex's 
spirits up.</p>
