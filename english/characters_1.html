<b>Crash</b> - Flash, brash and full of panache.  This is one bandicoot 
who knows he's the leading light of his species.  Don't be put off by 
Crash's lumbering ways, the blunder from downunder has the word 'funk' 
flowing through each one of his marsupial veins.  Brought up in the 
Outback of Australia, Crash used to think that 'marsupial' was just a 
way of saying that his mother's cooking was ready.  As his (now long and
 illustrious) career as a baddie beater took off, Crash was to pick up 
many little gems of information like this.  Whilst he never really 
threatened to shine academically, Crash has been known to threaten 
academics with his yo-yo.<br>
