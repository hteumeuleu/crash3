<b>Coco</b> - Crash's younger sister Coco (the precise parentage of both
 is unknown) looks nothing like her brother.  For one thing she's 
intelligent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enough said.  Allegations that she's not a 
natural blond have been flatly denied by Coco.  She is well-known for 
always taking the quickest mode of transport possible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
 if it means taking a turn on her favourite pet tiger then, well, he 
needs the exercise.  Sometimes, though, not even the finest tiger Bengal
 has to offer will satisfy Coco's need for speed; she's been known to 
take to the road, the sea and the sky in a variety of souped-up 
machinery.</p>
