<br>
<font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2" color="White">
We didn't want to make a flight simulator, just like we didn't want to 
make a motorcycle simulator and we didn't want to make a jet-ski 
simulator.  What we wanted to make was a Crash level, and a Crash level 
is all about seeing your enemy, knowing that if you don't do something, 
your enemy's going to do something to you.  So you're having constant 
challenges.  You don't need to watch the planes when they go around 
behind you because they're not going to come up behind you and cheaply 
hit you from behind.  They're going to come out in front of you and 
they're going to give you ample time to shoot them before turning 
around.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shooting at you.  So we're trying to create 
more of an arcade experience, more of a friendly experience than a 
simulator.</font></font></p><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2" color="#ff9900"><font face="Geneva, Arial" size="2" color="White">
