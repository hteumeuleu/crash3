<p><img src="/english/images/clock2.jpg" width="69" height="65" border="0" alt="" align="right"><b>"About Time"</b> - .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. said Cortex as his new ally landed on the planet hot-headedly.  But Cortex already knew enough about time to know that he could go anywhere in it: forwards, backwards, past, future.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he could even stretch his pants in five dimensions if he wanted to.  Having teamed up with the fiendish Dr N. Brio, together the pair had built a contraption that could take Cortex and his underlings anywhere they wanted to go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. today.  And for Cortex, that meant ultimate power in all temporal dimensions.  All he has to do to achieve it is collect the power-giving crystals hidden inconveniently in the mists of time and supreme rulership will be his.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And all Crash has to do to stop him is collect the crystals before Cortex can take them through his vortex.</p>
