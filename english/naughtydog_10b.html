<p>On the first motorcycle level, the best time after about half an hour
 of play was 51 seconds.  I started playing, and I realised if you cut 
this weird angle with the turbo, you could hold the turbo and be in a 
wheelie for the entire race.  And I won by four seconds.  So what we 
previously thought could only be improved by 0.3 or 0.03 of a second 
suddenly became totally irrelevant; because someone came up with 
something new and the time went down.</p>
