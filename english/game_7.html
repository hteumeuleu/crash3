<p>First there's the double-jump, then the powered spin.  These two combined actually allow Crash to jump still further, as executing a power-spin at the top of a double-jump will make him glide.  The difference is obvious: in <i>Crash 1</i>, Crash can jump 5 metres; in <i>Crash 2</i>, he can jump 5 metres; in <i>Crash 3</i>, he can jump an incredible 18 metres.  This is a bandicoot world record.</p>

<p>When Crash first gets a power-up, you'll have to use them to complete the levels immediately following it.  You might also need them to complete earlier levels; the bazooka, for example will allow Crash to hit things he couldn't reach before.  And by the time he learns to run, you can forget any times you've set in Time Trial mode.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
