<p align="left"><b>Bandicoot (continued)</b> - Bandicoots have developed
 very unusual feet where the second and third toes have actually grown 
together; many biologists attribute the animal's superior hopping 
abilities to these specialised feet.  In the Perambulidae Thrideeus 
species, this adaptation has been taken further than any other, with 
reports of double jumping, turbo spin attacks and body slams used to 
deal with prey.  Sadly, little empirical evidence exists of this 
species.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p align="left">On the other hand, some evolutionist theories put the 
development of the animal's distinctive toe structure down to 
behavioural factors.  Well, think about it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wouldn't 
repeatedly stubbing your foot on the bottom step every morning be bound 
to have some impact on your anatomy when applied over millions of years?
  Bandicoots are traditionally said to be clumsy creatures who put their
 feet right in it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
